# Analyzing Portfolio Risk and Return - Module 4 Challenge Assignment 

## Description

The goal of this challenge is to act as a quantitative analyst and evaluate new investment options to include in a client's portfolio. The analysis is performed on four funds: Soros Fund Management LLC, Paulson & Co Inc, Tiger Global Management LLC, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc., along with the S&P 500 index, over the period of 2014-10-01 to 2020-09-11. The dataset used for analysis, `whale_navs.csv`, can be found in the Resources folder of the project repository.

By analyzing various risk-management metrics such as daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe Ratios, and betas, we will recommend one of the funds to be included in the firm's suite of fund offerings.

The JupyterLab notebook consists of the following sections:

1. Importing the Data
2. Analyzing the Performance
3. Analyzing the Volatility
4. Analyzing the Risk
5. Analyzing the Risk-Return Profile
